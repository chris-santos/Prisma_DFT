 # Prisma software by Christiano dos Santos, PhD

  PRISMA - software that reads ORCA (versions 4 & 5) output file, extract IR frequencies, apply Lorentz convolution, and creates new csv file with infrared transmitance data in range 400-4000cm^-1.
  main functions: abrir arquivo => open .out ORCA file
  generate IR spectrum with lorentzian convolution
  find negative frequencies
  create batch file: it can read multiple folder structure and  convert .out -> csv files (this function needs to be improved for reading any data folder structure, it's hardcoded for my specific structure)
